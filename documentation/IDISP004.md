## Description

Don't ignore created IDisposable.

## Motivation

In the following code the file is opened but not closed.

```c#
public sealed class Foo
{
    public Foo()
    {
        File.OpenRead("file.txt");
    }
}
```

## How to fix violations

Assign the value to a field or property or use it in a using if it is a temporary value.


In the following code the file is opened but not closed.

```c#
public sealed class Foo
{
    public Foo()
    {
        using(var file = File.OpenRead("file.txt"))
        {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

### If the value ownership is transferred
